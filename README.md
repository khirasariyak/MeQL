# MeQL
Recently, we faced the deadlock recently in our production environment and I have to look into that. <br>

To be honest, I hated it when I started looking into the issue, but man, when I dive deep into the database internal architecture, woah ðŸ”¥ it is really a piece of art ðŸŽ¨.

MeQL is our own custom database whose architecture is inspired from SQLite.

Although, I didn't aim to implement the whole head to toe of the database, implemented enough to have better idea and insights about the internal. From the college days, I used to work on high level languages only but this time picked up C (though not a very good decision) but ChatGPT and couple of friends from Embedded domain helped me ðŸ˜‰.
