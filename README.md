# MeQL
MeQL is my own database whose architecture is inspired from SQLite.

Back to the time, when I was working on one my project, I encountered an issue with the SQL query. <br>
Later on the problem is fixed (thanks to StackOverflow, indeed!) but make me curious enough to kick off this project is started as a curiosuity to know the internals of database.

<br>

Although, I didn't aim to implement the whole head to toe of the database, implemented enough to have better idea and insights about the internal. From the college days, I used to work on high level languages only but this time picked up C (though not a very good decision) but ChatGPT and couple of friends from Embedded domain helped me ðŸ˜‰.
